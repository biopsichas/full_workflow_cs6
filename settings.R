# Settings ---------------------------------------------------------
## Project layers
## The input layers might be in different coordinate reference systems (CRS). 
## It is recommended to project all layers to the same CRS and check them
## before using them as model inputs. The model setup process checks if 
## the layer CRSs differ from the one of the basin boundary. By setting 
## 'proj_layer <- TRUE' the layer is projected if the CRS is different.
## If FALSE different CRS trigger an error.
project_layer <- TRUE

## Set the outlet point of the catchment
## Either define a channel OR a reservoir as the final outlet
## If channel then assign id_cha_out with the respective id from the 
## channel layer:
id_cha_out <- 50

## If reservoir then assign the respective id from the land layer to
##  id_res_out, otherwise leave as set
id_res_out <- NULL

## Threshold to eliminate land object connectivities with flow fractions
## lower than 'frc_thres'. This is necessary to i) simplify the connectivity
## network, and ii) to reduce the risk of circuit routing between land 
## objects. Circuit routing will be checked. If an error due to circuit 
## routing is triggered, then 'frc_thres' must be increased to remove 
## connectivities that may cause this issue.
frc_thres <- 0.3

## Define wetland land uses. Default the wetland land uses from the SWAT+ 
## plants.plt data base are defined as wetland land uses. Wetland land uses
## should only be changed by the user if individual wetland land uses were 
## defined in the plant data base.
wetland_landuse <- c('wehb', 'wetf', 'wetl', 'wetn')

## Maximum distance of a point source to a channel or a reservoir to be included
## as a point source object (recall) in the model setup
max_point_dist <- 500 #meters

crop_myr <- 'fesc' # prefix of multi-year schedules in management file
## multiple entries should have the same number of characters, 
## e.g.: crop_myr <- c('akgs', 'bsvg')
max_yr <- 4 # maximum number of years farmland grass can grow before it is 
## killed (should be <8)
## Do your multi-year farmland grass schedules consider the type of the 
## following crop (summer or winter crop)? (e.g., a '_1.5yr' schedule with a 
## kill op in spring allows for planting a summer crop immediately afterwards)
## If yes, you must define your summer crops
crop_s <- c('corn','csil','soyb')
## Do your summer crop schedules usually start with an operation in autumn 
## (e.g. tillage)? To combine them with farmland grass, it is necessary that you 
## provide 'half-year-schedules' ('half-year-schedules' are additional summer 
## crop schedules without operations in autumn) The adapted schedules should be 
## added to the crop management table with suffix '_0.5yr' (e.g. 'csil_0.5yr')
## If additional 'half-year-schedules' are not needed, because your normal 
## summer crop schedules do not start in autumn, type 'n'
additional_h_yr_sch_existing <- 'n' # 'y' (yes), 'n' (no)
